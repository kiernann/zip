Description: Cross-Platform 'zip' Compression Library. A
    replacement for the 'zip' function, that does not require any
    additional external tools on any platform. Based on the 'r-lib/zip'
    package <https://github.com/r-lib/zip> but modified to have consistent
    function names, better argument positions, and return modern data
    classes.
