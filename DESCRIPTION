Description: An forked alternative to the 'r-lib/zip' package
    <https://github.com/r-lib/zip>, a cross-platform compression library
    that does not require any additional tools on any platform. The
    changes made in this version aim for consistent function names, better
    argument position, and more human readable return data using the
    'tibble' and 'fs' packages.
