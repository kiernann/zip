The goal of zippr is to provide an alternative to the [zip] package built on
[miniz], a cross-platform, lossless, high performance data compression library.
The exact functionality of this package is still extremely fluid.

Three main types of changes are being made:

1. Consistently rename _all_ functions with `zip_*` to avoid masking
   `utils::zip()` and `utils::unzip()`. Match to names like `fs::dir_info()`.
2. Arrange arguments in a consistent order, accepting the primary file paths as
   the first argument for easy piping with `%>%`.
3. Return more data (sometimes invisibly) with human readable [tibble] data 
   frames and [fs] class vectors.

## Installation

You can install the development version of zippr from [GitHub][gh] with:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kiernann/zippr")
```

Install the release version of zip from [CRAN][cran] if needed.

```{r zip, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("zip")
```

## Usage

```{r libs}
library(magrittr)
library(zippr)
library(fs)
```

### Compressing

`zip_create()` takes uncompressed files and creates a compressed ZIP archive.
Simply supply all directories and files that you want to include in the archive.
Arguments have been arranged to accept piped paths.

It makes sense to change to the top-level directory of the files before
archiving them, so that the files are stored using a relative path name.

```{r zip_create}
tmp <- dir_ls("R") %>% 
  # pipe paths into zip
  zip_create("sources.zip")
```

```{r file_info}
file_info(tmp)[, 1:5]
```

Directories are added recursively by default.

`zip_append()` is similar to `zip_create()`, but it appends files to an existing
ZIP archive.

### Listing

`zip_list()` lists files in a ZIP archive. It returns a tibble with human
readable [fs] columns. To get just the file _names_, use `zip_ls()`.

```{r zip_info}
zip_info(tmp)
```

### Extracting

`zip_extract()` uncompresses a ZIP archive:

```{r}
out <- zip_extract(
  zipfile = tmp, 
  exdir = tempdir(), 
  junk_paths = TRUE,
)
file_info(out)[, 1:5]
```
